## Hi there 👋
I'm Rafie, a highschool student and a self taught fullstack developer in Malaysia
\nI design and create whatever sounds helpful for me or others
\nTrying to get ahead of most competitors of the same field by starting early, I mean who doesn't want 3 years something experience by graduation? :p
\nMy main tech stack is React-Django REST framework with Postgresql and MERN, and a bonus of MySQL
\nCurrently polishing a Voting website for a school project and creating a food ordering site for my girlfriend's made up cafe
\nFun Facts about me:
 -I love Cosplaying, Video games and caffeine
 -I have a cat and a kitten
 -If you can't tell I really like Furina (and also Scaramouche) from genshin Impact
