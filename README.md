## Hi there 👋
I'm Rafie, a highschool student and a self taught fullstack developer in Malaysia.

I design and create whatever sounds helpful for me or others.

Trying to get ahead of most competitors of the same field by starting early, I mean who doesn't want 3 years something experience by graduation? :p

My main tech stack is React-Django REST framework with Postgresql and MERN, and a bonus of MySQL.

Currently polishing a Voting website for a school project and creating a food ordering site for my girlfriend's made up cafe.

Fun Facts about me:

 -I love Cosplaying, Video games and caffeine
 -I have a cat and a kitten
 -If you can't tell I really like Furina (and also Scaramouche) from genshin Impact
